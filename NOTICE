The Xmidt projects like the Prometheus documentation and site generation so much
we are using it for our site generation and documentation organization.  We
started with the prometheus docs hash 7bbd3dcd93cabf2270fd3aa46b22d2e59ce01711.

We plan to bring in fixes from the prometheus documentation project as they are
appropriate.
