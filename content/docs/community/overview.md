# Community
XMiDT and its ecosystem is developed in the open.  Here are some of the 
channels we use to communicate and contribute:


## Issue Tracker
Use the GitHub issue tracker for the various [XMiDT repositories](http://github.com/xmidt-org)
to file bugs and features request.  If you need support, please ask your questions
to the [discussion site](https://github.com/xmidt-org/xmidt/discussions) rather than filing a GitHub issue.

*Please do not ask individual project members for support. Use the channels
above instead, where the whole community can help you and benefit from the
solutions provided.*

## Contributing

We welcome community contributions! Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in
the respective XMiDT repository for instructions on how to submit changes. If
you are planning on making more elaborate or controversial changes, please
discuss them on the [discussion site](https://github.com/xmidt-org/xmidt/discussions) before
sending a pull request.

## Discussion

An important part of the community is discussing design proposals, pull requests,
operational experiences and ideas for making the projects better.  We have
the [discussion site](https://github.com/xmidt-org/xmidt/discussions) to help us find and keep track
of all the various topics.
