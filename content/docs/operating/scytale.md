# Scytale

# Installation
-   [RPM](https://xmidt.io/download/#scytale)
-   [Binary](https://xmidt.io/download/#scytale)
-   Docker (Link TBC)

# Configuration
Refer to [configuration file](https://github.com/xmidt-org/scytale/blob/master/scytale.yaml)
for how to configure scytale.

## Connecting to petasos
To provide the petasoses that scytale should connect to, the fanout block in scytale's configuration should look similar to the example below:

```yaml
fanout:
  endpoints: [ "https://PETASOS_HOSTNAME:PRIMARY_PORT/api/v2/device/send" ]
  authorization: dXNlcjpwYXNz
  fanoutTimeout: "127s"
  clientTimeout: "127s"
  concurrency: 10
```
Where PETASOS_HOSTNAME is your Petasos DNS record, docker container, or ip address listening on the
PRIMARY_PORT.

_**NOTE**_: if you have domain or host certificates available, we recommend
always running the service (and all components in the service) in https mode.

_**NOTE**_: dXNlcjpwYXNz is an example auth string for petasos. DO NOT use
this in production.

# Validation
## Test Health
```bash
curl HOSTNAME:HEALTH_PORT/health -i
```

## Test Device
Connect a device to talaria, described [here](/docs/operating/getting_started/talaria/#test-device-connection).

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Basic AUTHOKEN" HOSTNAME:PRIMARY_PORT/api/v2/device/DEVICE_ID/stat
```
Where HOSTNAME is your DNS record, docker container, or ip address listening on the
PRIMARY_PORT. Where AUTHOKEN is the `authHeader` in the yaml configuration file.
Where DEVICE_ID is the device that is connected to talaria.

```

# Troubleshooting
The most common error is getting a 404, meaning the [device is not connected](/docs/operating/troubleshooting/#device-is-not-showing-up-in-cluster-talaria) to the cluster.

# Next
scytale is up and running now; let's stand up [tr1d1um](/docs/operating/tr1d1um).
