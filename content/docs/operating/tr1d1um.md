# Installation

-   Docker (Link TBC)

# Configuration
Refer to [configuration file](https://github.com/xmidt-org/tr1d1um/blob/master/tr1d1um.yaml)
for how to configure tr1d1um.

## Connecting to scytale
Under the fanout block of the yaml file you will have

```yaml
targetURL: http://SCYTALE_HOSTNAME:PRIMARY_PORT
```
Where SCYTALE_HOSTNAME is your Scytale DNS record, docker container, or ip address listening on the
PRIMARY_PORT.

_**NOTE**_: if you have domain or host certificates available, we recommend
always running the service (and all components in the service) in https mode.

_**NOTE**_: dXNlcjpwYXNz is an example auth string for tr1d1um. DO NOT use
this in production.
